## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-30

* **Major Performance Overhaul**: Refactored `MovingBackground` to use a single `Ticker` and `CustomPainter`. This significantly reduces CPU/GPU usage and provides much smoother animations.
* **New Animation Types**: Added `pulse`, `scale`, and `move` animation types to `MovingBackground`.
* **New Components**: 
    * Added `BubbleBackground`: A high-performance bouncing bubbles effect.
    * Added `RainBackground`: A parallax rain effect.
* **Pause/Resume**: Added `isPaused` property to all background components.
* **Improved API**: `MovingCircle` is now a lightweight data class.
* **Better Randomness**: Improved the way circles move to random positions for a more natural feel.
* **Bug Fixes**: Fixed issues with animation stuttering and memory leaks.
